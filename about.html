                <p>Hello, and welcome! I hold the degrees of Master of Education (School Psychology specialty) and Master of Social Work. I am licensed in the state of North Carolina as a Licensed Clinical Social Worker (#C011908).</p>
                <p>I was born and raised in North Carolina and lived briefly in New York on Long Island before returning home to NC to raise a family in 1999.   I earned my Bachelor’s degree in Psychology (1992) from the University of North Carolina at Greensboro, my Master’s Degree in Education/School Psychology (1994) from UNC-Chapel Hill and my Master’s Degree in Social Work (2016) from North Carolina State University. I have experience working as a School Psychologist at every school age level, as a Hospice Social Worker, as a Grief Counselor, as a Kindergarten teacher, and most importantly as a stay-at-home mom. I feel that my diverse background and life experience help me to connect with my clients in a wide variety of ways. </p>
                <p>As an NC native, I very much enjoy the beautiful land this state has to offer. My husband and I love spending time with our family in the mountains and at the beach.  Our 1 ½ year old rescue pup, Francis, joins us everywhere we go!  We have 2 adult children who both live in NC as well, which is a lovely gift as a parent. </p>
                <p>Outside of my practice, I enjoy running, traveling, reading, spending time with family and friends, and even tried my hand at knitting during the first year of the pandemic! I have always had a love for creativity and often use art as a therapeutic activity with my clients. I consider myself a lifelong learner and am so privileged to have a job that affords me the opportunity to learn every day from my clients. </p>
                <p>...</p>
                <p class="bottom-p">I look forward to meeting you!</p>
