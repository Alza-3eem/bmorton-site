        <h3>My practice at a glance</h3>
        <p>Being human in this world can be tough. My goal as a therapist is to sit with my clients in these difficult times.<br>I provide my clients a relaxed, comfortable, and trusting environment where they can feel heard, seen, and valued.<br>I see it as a great privilege to partner with my clients as they share and explore their stories and experiences.<br>Together, we can navigate what can often feel like an overwhelming world.<br>I utilize an integrative approach that is collaborative and relationship-based, strengths-focused, with strong emphasis<br>on Cognitive Behavioral and Client-Centered therapies. I address issues including death of a loved one, living<br>with / supporting someone who is living with terminal illness, life transitions, anxiety. I have experience working with<br>adults, adolescents and children.<br>I believe that compassion, humor, and collaboration help to create a comfortable counseling space for my clients. </p>

    <div class="quote">
        "Anything that's human is mentionable, and anything that is mentionable can be<br>more manageable. When we can talk about our feelings, they become less<br>overwhelming, less upsetting, and less scary. The people we trust with that<br>important talk can help us know that we are not alone."<br>-Fred Rogers
